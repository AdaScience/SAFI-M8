For all automotive components, quality assurance is a must. Before deciding whether a starter motor is acceptable, it should go through multiple tests. Samples of the starter motors product line were read differently in the dataset. The last difficulty is deciding whether the product is defective or not. However, machine learning algorithms can be used to predict defective products based on the knowledge in the data given for each sample. This should reduce inspection time and save steps in the quality process. 

Your job is to use the given dataset, preprocess the data and use different classification algorithms to predict the defective product based on the inspection readings for the other samples in the dataset. A high prediction accuracy would be considered the most effective way to save time in the production process.
