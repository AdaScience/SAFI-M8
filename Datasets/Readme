Every sample in the dataset was subjected to several inspections. Each sample obtained a different result for each inspection. It is possible to consider the last inspection OP130 as the output that determines whether a product is defective or not: 1 is OK, 2 is defective. In test samples, OP130 reading should be predicted using classification algorithms to determine if the sample is acceptable. the dataset was presented in five files in CSV format
